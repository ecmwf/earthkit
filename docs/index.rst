Welcome to earthkit's documentation
======================================================

.. warning::

    This project is **BETA** and will be **Experimental** for the foreseeable future. Interfaces and functionality are likely to change, and the project itself may be scrapped. **DO NOT** use this software in any project/software that is operational.

.. warning::

    This documentation is still work in progress and can only be regarded as a **DRAFT**.


**earthkit** is a new open-source Python project led by ECMWF, providing powerful tools for speeding up weather and climate science workflows by simplifying data access, processing, analysis, visualisation and much more.

**earthkit** offers **multiple interoperable** :ref:`software components <components>` built on top of well-established open-source Python libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib. earthkit also integrates and leverages the robust and operations-ready software stack that is familiar to ECMWF production systems (e.g. :xref:`eccodes`, FDB, etc).

The interface of :ref:`earthkit components <components>` is designed to be high-level in order to provide common tools to support activities across ECMWF and beyond. The design of the components also takes **scalability** into account, so researchers can enjoy efficiency whilst providing easier transfer to operations.

**earthkit** is still under development, but three components, :xref:`earthkit-data`, :xref:`earthkit-maps` and :xref:`earthkit-meteo` are now available in beta through PyPI and their GitHub repositories.
