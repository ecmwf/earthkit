   For an interactive overview, see the `earthkit website <https://ecmwf.github.io/earthkit-website/>`__.

**earthkit** is a new open-source Python project led by ECMWF, providing powerful tools for speeding up weather and climate science workflows by simplifying data access, processing, analysis, visualisation and much more.

**earthkit** offers **multiple interoperable** :ref:`software components <components>` built on top of well-established open-source Python libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib. earthkit also integrates and leverages the robust and operations-ready software stack that is familiar to ECMWF production systems (e.g. :xref:`eccodes`, FDB, etc).

The interface of :ref:`earthkit components <components>` is designed to be high-level in order to provide common tools to support activities across ECMWF and beyond. The design of the components also takes **scalability** into account, so researchers can enjoy efficiency whilst providing easier transfer to operations.

**earthkit** is still under development but some components are already available in beta through PyPI and their GitHub repositories.
